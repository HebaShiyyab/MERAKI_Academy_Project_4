          Corona viruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases
          in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory
          tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in
          humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by
          other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal
          varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In cows and pigs they
          cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and
          encephalomyelitis.

	  There is no specific diet for diabetes. But the foods you eat not only make a difference 
	  to how you manage your diabetes,
	   but also to how well you feel and how much energy you have

		The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and
		 nutrients to the tissues while removing carbon dioxide and waste. When a person exercises, 
		 the heart rate increases due to the heart pumping harder to send more oxygen (via the blood) 
		 to the surrounding muscles at work. This results in increased blood flow, and also an increase
		  in the blood volume returning to the heart. With regular exercise over time, the heart adapts 
		  to the increased blood flow and the left heart becomes enlarged. This allows the left heart to
		   hold more blood and more blood is delivered with each heartbeat, even during rest. Hence, the 
		   resting heart rate of a sporty individual is lower as each beat delivers a larger volume of blood,
		    and fewer beats are needed.
